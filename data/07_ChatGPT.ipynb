    "* How many `human-bot` teams are in the `Medium` category?\n",
    "* Create a subsample of 50% of your data.\n",
    "* Create samples for a 8-fold cross validation test.\n",
    "* Select columns that are numeric and save it as a new DataFrame.\n",
    "* Remove the columns `bot_PRReviewComment` and `bot_MergedPR` from the DataFrame.\n",
