    "#### A Quick Aside: Defining a Path\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also define absolute or relative filepaths and use those filepaths as needed. A relative path is the path that is relative to the working directory location on your machine. An absolute path is a path that contains the entire path to the file or directory that you need to access. This path will begin at the home directory of your machine and will end with the file or directory that you wish to access. \n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute paths ensure that Python can find the exact file on your machine. However, machines can have a different path constructions, depending on the operating system, and contain usernames that are unique to that specific machine. There are ways to overcome this issue and others associated with finding files on different machines. The `os.path.join()` and `os.path.exists()` functions are particularly useful for finding files on different machines.

    "## Data Frame Overview\n",

    "Okay, let's talk about data. We can organize data into a data matrix (i.e., a table) where each row represents a thing observed and each column represents a variable. We might also refer to this as *tabular* data as the data is organized and displayed as a table. In the example below, some employee data for a fictional company with 63 employees is presented in a table. \n",

    "### pandas DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can use the Python Data Analysis Library (pandas) to work with tabular data. This library provides the tools and data structures we need to effectively work with data. To do so, we need to load pandas in our notebook. Recall that we can simplify its name based on standard convention as we will use it over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In pandas, the primary data structure is a `DataFrame`. This is what we will use to represent and interact with our data. For those of you who have experience with *R Statistical Software*, you are likely already familiar with the concept of a data frame. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is it exactly? A pandas `DataFrame` is a 2-dimensional data structure. It can store data of different types (including characters, integers, floating point values, categorical, and more) in columns. Stated another way, it is a table with rows and columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's return to the fictional employee data example provided above to highlight the qualities of a DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each row is a single *observation*: an employee.\n",
    "  * That means that the data in a row are *related* to each other.\n",
    "  * In this case, the values in a row all correspond to a single employee.\n",
    "* Each column is a single *variable*: employee ID, tenure, leadership, title.\n",
    "  * Columns are *named* (e.g., 'Tenure_Months' is the name of the second column).\n",
    "  * All columns within a DataFrame contain the same number of items and rows (63 in this example).\n",
    "  * Each variable has a specific data type (string, integer, boolean, categorical in this example, respectively).\n",
    "    * Note that while different columns may have different types, *each column must contain only one type of data*!\n",
    "    * In Python, you may encounter a `None` object which represents the absence of a value (or a null value) in a column.\n",
    "    * You may also encounter a `NaN` (Not a Number) object which represents undefined or nonsensical numerical values.\n",
    "    * [Here's a Medium article describing the difference between None and NaN](https://medium.com/data-and-beyond/none-nan-null-and-zero-in-python-ac326cfb73a2).\n",
    "\n",
    "These details ultimately represent metadata, or data about data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Column names\n",
    "* Column data types\n",
    "* Length of columns | Number of rows\n",

    "#### Data Frame Differences: R vs. Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Data frames are built into base R. This means that the functions, commands, and other operations within R work very well with data frames. In contrast, data frames are provided by an external package (pandas) in Python. This means that data frames are not as well integrated in Python as in R. To help overcome this limitation, we can rely on data science libraries like NumPy and scikit-learn. Keep in mind that software updates may break the functionality of data frames. You may need to revert back to an older version of a library/module/package to regain functionality. I tend to prefer R for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization due to these and  other reasons. \n",

    "### From Spreadsheet to DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "If the fictional employee data table provided above were stored in a spreadsheet, we could import it in Python as a pandas DataFrame. For example, if the data were contained within a CSV file named 'employee_data.csv', we could import the data by using the pandas `read_csv()` function and store the data like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "employees = pd.read_csv(\"employee_data.csv\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example also shows the use of our defined name `pd` for `pandas` functions! Also, while this example is based on a CSV file, pandas can support many file formats or data sources (csv, excel, sql, json, parquet, …), each of them with the prefix read_*:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "pd.read_csv(\"our_data.csv\")\n",
    "pd.read_excel(\"our_data.excel\")\n",

    "After reading in data, you should **always** check it! You should never assume data is perfect and ready for analysis. You should inspect data for errors, inconsistencies, and missing values. You should also verify data types because this information will influence the accuracy and appropriateness of various operations applied to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Familiarizing yourself with the data in a DataFrame may entail selecting specific columns or rows, sorting data, and selecting data based on conditions. In this section, we will go over some approaches for inspecting data.\n",

    "#### Heads and Tails\n",
    "\n",
    "To quickly inspect the data, we can use the `head(n)` or `tail(n)` functions, where `n` is the number of lines that should be returned. Specifically, we can use `head(n)` to view the first `n` lines in a DataFrame and we can use `tail(n)` to view the last `n` lines in a DataFrame. Alternatively, you can display the first and last five rows of the DataFrame with just the DataFrame name.\n",

    "\n",
    "All modern statistical packages provide functions that perform mathematical operations and dates and times. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have data on employee work hours and we need to calculate pay for hourly employees. For each day over a five-day span we have the time the employee clocked in and the time the employee clocked out. We need to calculate the total number of hours the employee worked by using one of two methods: 1) we convert the date-time values into separate numerical values such as hours, minutes, and seconds and sum up the values or 2) use a date-time function that will automatically convert for us and provide you the total hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second option is the obvious choice as it requires minimal computational skills on our part. One of the downsides to most statistical packages is that they do not convert date-time values into date-time objects. That is, date-time values are read as categorical values made up of character strings; we cannot perform math on character strings. Converting date-time values in any statistical program requires work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go over how to convert date-time values from *object* data types to *date-time* data types. We will use the data in the tennis_serve_time.csv file for this example. [This dataset is from the R fivethirtyeight package](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/fivethirtyeight/tennis_serve_time.html) and is provided in the data folder of this week's repo."
